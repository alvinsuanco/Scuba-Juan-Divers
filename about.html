				<h3 class="pt-3">WE LOVE NATURE!</h3>
				<p class="text-justify">The earth is too beautiful to waste, with the Philippines as the global epicentre of marine biodiversity. As a non-government organization that aims to protect and preserve the Philippines’ rich marine life through diving and exploration, we actively seek and keep an eye for unexplored diving sites. With this, we establish  contacts with local authorities to help us implement advance protection methods on the sites and and rescue trainings to help local water rescue units more efficiently carry out rescue operations. Our main goal in each exploration is to help protect and preserve these God-given resources so that the next generations can experience what we are enjoying today.</p>
